		<h2>Current Prime Minister Of India</h2>
		<p>
		  <b>Damodardas Modi </b>(Gujarati: [ˈnəɾendɾə dɑmodəɾˈdɑs ˈmodiː] (listen);
			 born 17 September 1950) [b] is an Indian politician serving as the 14th 
			 and current prime minister of India since May 2014. Modi was the chief 
			 minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 and is the Member of Parliament from 
			 Varanasi. He is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and of the 
			 Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu nationalist paramilitary
			 volunteer organisation. He is the longest-serving prime minister from outside
			 the Indian National Congress. Modi was born and raised in Vadnagar in northeastern
			 Gujarat, where he completed his secondary education. He was introduced to the RSS
			 at age eight. He has reminisced about helping out after school at his father's tea
			 stall at the Vadnagar railway station, a description not reliably corroborated.
			 At age 18, he was married to Jashodaben Modi, whom he abandoned soon after. He
			 first publicly acknowledged her as his wife more than four decades later when
			 required to do so by Indian law, but has made no contact with her since. Modi
			 has asserted he had travelled in northern India for two years after leaving 
			 his parental home, visiting a number of religious centres, but few details 
			 of his travels have emerged. Upon his return to Gujarat in 1971, he became 
			 a full-time worker for the RSS. After the state of emergency was declared by
			 Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1975, he went into hiding. The RSS assigned
			 him to the BJP in 1985 and he held several positions within the party 
			 hierarchy until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary.
